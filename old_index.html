					I posted pictures from my graduation yesterday. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the College of Engineering at the University of Missouri with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

					Added link to view my photos! See Photos! I'm going to try and add any graduation photos there so everyone can have access to them. Also, since many of you are going to head home afterwards, I'm not going to bother to reserve the American Legion. I don't think we'll have a need.

					Mom was talking to me about throwing some sort of party as well. I'm looking into the logistics of that. My graduation is in the evening and some of you will have to drive pretty far. I might do a lunch get together Saturday for those who stay in town, or I might see about getting the American Legion to let us use their place Friday night. I'll keep you posted.

					Hey everybody. I threw this website up in a hurry for two purposes. First, I actually wanted to use the domain name that I purchased. Secondly, I also thought it would be a good idea to have a quick reference to information about my upcoming graduation for my family. So I'll be periodically updating this page and posting additional information about my graduation. Hope it helps everyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					On that note, if you would like a graduation invitation sent to you, please contact me and let me know. I'm currently working on an invitation list but I'd hate to inadvertently leave someone out.
				</p>
				<p>
					I guess that's it for now. I look forward to seeing everyone in December. Take care.
				</p>
